Goals:
Provide basic Web3 and digital literacy education for 50+ orphans and vulnerable kids in Bauchi.
Create free Hausa-language Web3 tutorials, both online and offline.
Distribute devices or provide access to learning tools for underprivileged children.
Build a small local Web3 learning community with volunteers and mentors.
Connect students to internship or further learning opportunities in the Web3 space.
Why It Matters:
In many parts of Northern Nigeria, children—especially orphans—have little to no access to quality education, let alone digital or tech training. Web3 offers global opportunities, and we want to make sure no child is left behind. This project is a bridge between vulnerable youth and the future of technology's 
What We Need Support For:
Funding for educational materials, internet access, and learning tools (tablets, phones, etc.)
Support in developing Hausa-language blockchain tutorials and content
Stipends for local volunteer teachers
Partnership with Web3 projects, NGOs, and donors to scale the impacts 
Vision for Impact:
We believe that through Web3, the next generation of African kids—regardless of their background—can build a better future. With your support, FutureChain Kids will be their first step into the world of technology and opportunities 
Let’s build a decentralized, inclusive future—starting with the kids who need it most.
